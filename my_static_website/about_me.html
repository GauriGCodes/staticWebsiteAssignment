        <p class="aboutme">
            Hello, I am Gauri from Rajasthan, India. I am currently pursuing my Graduate Degree in Computer Science at
            Pace
            University.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme">
            I completed my undergraduate in 2019 in India. After pursuing my undergrad degree I started working at
            Barclays
            Bank
            as a Graduate Analyst. I worked as a DevOps Engineer on multiple technologies like chef, jenkins and linux.
            Moreover, I was part of the team that handled the infrastructure of 70k servers. I worked outside of the
            business
            hours to support production systems and prevented many outages resulted in an improved customer experience.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme">
            In July 2020, I started worked as a full stack developer at Barclays Investment Bank. I worked on numerous
            technologies like Angular, Java, Springboot, Teamcity and Docker. I developed various projects like hiring
            status utility that allowed management to keep track of new joiners and interviews. Also, I created a log
            searching utility that allowed vendors and business Analyst
            to search server logs in a user friendly manner.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme">
            Apart from my work experience I love volunteering. I've been an active member of many NGOs in India. I've
            been part of LifeSkills by Barclays
            where we help underpriviledged kids with overall personality development. Also, I like exploring new places,
            meeting new people, watching tennis,
            dancing and spending time on reddit.
